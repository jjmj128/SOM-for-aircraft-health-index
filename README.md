# SOM for aircraft health index

This code has been created to build a health index from simulated Jet engine data using Self-Organizing Maps.

The code is composed of two files, the main one is II_SOM.py which containes the executable code. Minor changes must be done to set the correct training data directory.

The file I_Data_process.py is a complementary file intended for the data processing before the training of the self organizing map.
